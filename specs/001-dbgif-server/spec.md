# Feature Specification: DBGIF Server Development

**Feature Branch**: `001-dbgif-server`
**Created**: 2025-09-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "dbgif server를 개발할거야. 처음으로 시작하는 단계이기 때문에 가장 기본적인 필수기능을 지원하는 서버가 될거야, 그리고 이 서버를 태스트할수있는 테스트 클라이언트도 같이 작성할거야. 이건 개인 프로젝트야."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to build and test a DBGIF protocol server so that I can establish the foundation for a debugging interface system with basic essential functionality.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the DBGIF server is running, **When** a test client connects to the server, **Then** the connection should be established successfully
2. **Given** a test client is connected to the server, **When** the client sends a basic protocol message, **Then** the server should process and respond appropriately
3. **Given** the server and test client are running, **When** basic debugging operations are performed, **Then** the server should handle them according to the DBGIF protocol

### Edge Cases
- What happens when multiple clients try to connect simultaneously?
- How does the system handle malformed protocol messages?
- What occurs when the connection is unexpectedly dropped?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST implement basic DBGIF protocol server functionality
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept client connections with maximum 100 concurrent connections
- **FR-003**: System MUST process and respond to basic DBGIF protocol messages
- **FR-004**: System MUST include a test client for server validation
- **FR-005**: Test client MUST be able to connect to the DBGIF server
- **FR-006**: Test client MUST be able to send basic protocol commands to the server
- **FR-007**: Server MUST handle connection lifecycle (connect, communicate, disconnect)
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide basic tracing debugging operations
- **FR-009**: Server MUST implement DBGIF protocol version 1.0.0
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle errors gracefully with simple error reporting

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **DBGIF Server**: Core server component that implements the DBGIF protocol and manages client connections
- **Test Client**: Validation tool that connects to the server and exercises basic protocol functionality
- **Protocol Messages**: Communication units exchanged between client and server following DBGIF specification
- **Client Connection**: Active session between a test client and the DBGIF server

# Feature Specification: Replace Polling with USB Hotplug Detection

**Feature Branch**: `002-usb-hotplug`
**Created**: 2025-09-15
**Status**: Updated
**Input**: User description: "ÏóÖÎç∞Ïù¥Ìä∏ÌñàÍ≥† Í∏∞Ï°¥ Ìè¥ÎßÅÎ∞©ÏãùÏùÄ Ìï´ÌîåÎü¨Í∑∏Î∞©ÏãùÏúºÎ°ú ÏôÑÏ†Ñ ÎåÄÏ≤¥Ìï¥Ï§ò"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí User wants to replace existing polling-based device discovery with true hotplug mechanism
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: users, system, USB devices, existing polling system
   ‚Üí Actions: replace, detect instantly, eliminate polling, reduce resource usage
   ‚Üí Data: device state changes, hotplug events
   ‚Üí Constraints: maintain compatibility, improve performance
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Migration strategy for existing connections during replacement
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: instant detection without periodic scanning
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Focus on eliminating polling overhead and improving responsiveness
6. Identify Key Entities (hotplug events, system resource usage)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Migration approach needs clarification
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using the DBGIF server, I want the system to replace the current polling-based USB device detection with an event-driven hotplug mechanism, so that device connections and disconnections are detected instantly with minimal system resource usage, eliminating the overhead of continuous polling.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the system is using the old polling-based detection, **When** the hotplug mechanism is activated, **Then** polling is completely disabled and device detection switches to event-driven mode
2. **Given** the hotplug mechanism is active, **When** I plug in a USB device, **Then** the device is detected within 500ms without any polling overhead
3. **Given** the hotplug mechanism is active, **When** I unplug a device, **Then** the disconnection is detected within 500ms and resources are immediately freed
4. **Given** multiple devices are connected, **When** using hotplug detection, **Then** system resource usage is significantly lower than the previous polling approach
5. **Given** no USB activity is occurring, **When** the system is idle, **Then** CPU usage for device monitoring should be near zero (no periodic polling)

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the hotplug mechanism fails and needs to fallback to polling temporarily?
- How does the system handle the transition from polling to hotplug while devices are already connected?
- What occurs if hotplug events are missed or delayed by the operating system?
- How are existing active connections maintained during the polling-to-hotplug migration?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST completely eliminate periodic polling for USB device discovery
- **FR-002**: System MUST detect USB device connections within 500ms using event-driven hotplug mechanism
- **FR-003**: System MUST detect USB device disconnections within 500ms using event-driven hotplug mechanism
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain backwards compatibility with existing client interfaces during the migration
- **FR-005**: System MUST consume less than 1% CPU when no USB activity is occurring (vs current polling overhead)
- **FR-006**: System MUST gracefully migrate from polling to hotplug without losing existing device connections
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide fallback to polling mode if hotplug mechanism fails
- **FR-008**: System MUST support both Android USB devices and USB bridge cables with the new hotplug detection
- **FR-009**: System MUST notify clients of device events with the same interface as before (transparent upgrade)
- **FR-010**: System MUST reduce overall system resource usage compared to the current polling implementation

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Hotplug Event**: Event-driven notification from the operating system when USB devices are connected or disconnected, includes device details and timestamp
- **Polling Migration State**: Tracks the transition from polling-based to event-driven detection, ensuring no devices are lost during the switch
- **Resource Usage Metrics**: Measurements of CPU and memory consumption before and after the polling replacement, used to verify performance improvements
- **Detection Mechanism State**: Current active detection method (polling, hotplug, or fallback mode) with capability to switch between them

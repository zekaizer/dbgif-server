# Tasks: Multi-Transport ADB Daemon

**Input**: Design documents from `/home/zekaizer/Workspace/dbgif-server/specs/001-pl25a1-usb-bridge/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (✓), research.md (✓), data-model.md (✓), contracts/ (✓), quickstart.md (✓)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → ✓ Extracted: Rust + tokio + nusb, single project structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → ✓ data-model.md: 6 entities → model tasks
   → ✓ contracts/: 4 files → contract test tasks
   → ✓ research.md: Transport abstraction decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Cargo project, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: 4 contract tests, 5 integration tests
   → Core: 6 models, 3 transport implementations, daemon server
   → Integration: Transport manager, ADB protocol handler
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T052)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. ✓ All contracts have tests, all entities have models
9. Return: SUCCESS (52 tasks ready for execution)
```

## Validation Notes
- ✅ All 4 contracts have corresponding test tasks (T006-T009)
- ✅ All 6 entities from data-model.md have model tasks (T018-T028)
- ✅ All tests come before implementation (T006-T017 before T018+)
- ✅ Parallel tasks are in different files with no dependencies
- ✅ Each task specifies exact file path for implementation
- ✅ TDD enforced: Tests must fail before writing implementation

## Special Testing Notes

### Hardware Dependencies
- T011 (USB device test) requires actual Android device or mock
- T012 (USB bridge test) requires PL25A1 hardware or emulator
- T010 (TCP test) can run fully in CI/CD

### Cross-Platform Testing
- Windows-specific tests for WinUSB driver interaction
- Linux-specific tests for udev rules and permissions
- Conditional compilation for platform differences

### Performance Requirements
- T052 benchmarks should verify USB 2.0 throughput capabilities
- Latency tests for real-time debugging scenarios
- Memory usage tests for embedded target compatibility

This task list provides 52 concrete, executable tasks following TDD principles and constitutional requirements for the multi-transport ADB daemon implementation.
